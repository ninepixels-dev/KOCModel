                <h2>Concept Equipment Spacing Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Concept spacing is related to achieving a reasonably safe layout aimed at decrease project and operational costs because appropriate separation between hazards typically decreases protection requirements. For example, a control room not exposed to significant explosion loads from a processing unit would have no need to be as structurally robust as would be the case if it were poorly located.</p>
                <p>Adequate spacing between hazard areas reduces the overall major accident potential. The optimum layout should achieve a balance between loss prevention, construction, maintenance and operation requirements.</p>
