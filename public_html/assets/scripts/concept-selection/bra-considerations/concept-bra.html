                <h2>Concept BRA Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The BRA process is linked to the KOC PGS. It is applicable to (1) all new facilities and associated buildings, and (2) modification of the existing buildings and hydrocarbon containing process equipment which has the potential to impact the existing buildings. The detail and complexity of the assessment increase with each phase.
                <p>BRA Phase 1 is undertaken during the Concept Selection (PGS 2.1) and provides the initial distances between buildings and facilities and associated process units.
                <p>The building siting assessment is intended primarily for occupied and functionally significant buildings. Other buildings that do not meet the occupancy or functional significance criteria should be reviewed during BRA Phase 2 using the Building Review Checklist given in Table 3.1 for identification of any areas of improvement.
                <p>Definitions of the occupied and functional significant buildings are:
                <ul>
                    <li>An occupied building is a building where there are regularly more than 10 people at one time, or the building has more than 200 man-hours accumulated over a week. Special consideration should be given to the situation where a significant source of hazard is only present intermittently, but the occupation of the building is linked directly to the presence of the hazard.  The use of annualised occupancy levels may lead to an underestimation of the risk and result in buildings representing a significant risk being excluded from the assessment.</li>
                    <li>A building is defined as Functionally Significant if the building is:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Required for emergency response (whether personnel is expected to remain or take refuge in the building during an emergency, or if it supports operation of emergency control systems)</li>
                        <li>Necessary for continued operation of other process units (i.e. units which are not affected by an incident, whether the related systems are emergency systems or not),</li>
                        <li>A building that needs structural survival in case of an explosion to enable shutdown and decommissioning of the damaged process area, and</li>
                        <li>The economic impact of loss of the building is significant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Determination of building distances during Concept Selection may be achieved by using Field Spacing Tool (for Concept Selection).</li>
                </ul>
