                <h2>Concept Selection (PGS 2.1) Field Spacing</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This section relates to the field spacing arrangements during Concept Selection stage of the project (PGS Gate 2.1). The intent here is to allow the end user to easily and efficiently consider the field spacing to ensure minimal changes during more mature stages of the project.</p>
                <h3>General Considerations</h3>
                <p>During the concept selection stage of the project, the end user must consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The siting of the proposed facility in relation to surrounding areas, in particular where the proposed facility is in close proximity to public and 3rd parties, and </li>
                    <li>Facility layout and segregation arrangements for the proposed facility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The principal implications associated with the concept field spacing are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In relation to Facility Siting: a major accident at a facility has the potential to impact surrounding areas. It is, therefore, important to protect the surrounding areas from exposure to spills, fires, explosions, heat, smoke, odours, hazardous releases and noise, in particular where the facility is proposed to be located in close proximity to the private residential and commercial areas (i.e. public and 3rd parties)</li>
                    <li>In relation to the Facility Layout and Segregation: a major accident has the potential to escalate due to inadequate means of physical isolation between adjacent process units within the same assessed facility, and cause further escalation due to insufficient measures for control of major accidents, as well as, for emergency response, evacuation, and rescue</li>
                    <li>In relation to the Equipment Spacing: the implications are similar to the implications under layout and segregation in that the principal consideration is prevention of escalation of a major accident from one item of equipment to another, within the same process unit, due to the insufficient physical isolation between the items of equipment.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Preliminary Considerations</h3>
                <p>Before making arrangements for field spacing during Concept Selection stage of the project, the end user shall ensure that the following items have been achieved:
                <ul>
                    <li>Safety engineering considerations, discussed in Guidelines Section 4 have been reviewed and provided for</li>
                    <li>Preliminary considerations for concept selection field spacing have been reviewed and addressed. This includes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Establishing the scope of the concept field spacing</li>
                        <li>Assembling a delivery team</li>
                        <li>Conducting survey and data collection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <i style="color: red;">Further information related to these considerations is given in the Guidelines, Section 5.1.</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Before commencing field spacing for all project stages (and in particular PGS 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1), the end user should consider the general Safety Engineering Consideration as given in the Guidelines, Part B.</p>
                <p>Additional references to the pertinent sections in the Guidelines which should be reviewed by the end user for field spacing during Concept Selection (PGS 2.1) are as follows:</p>
