                <h2>Concept Layout & Segregation Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>During the facility siting for concept selection the end user should consider the following layout and segregation considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using hazard assessments for each facility operation to assist with establishing the layout or orientation of process unit battery limits within the proposed facility</li>
                    <li>Reviewing the possible accident events and the consequences for the proposed facility</li>
                    <li>Selecting a layout which is expected to reduce the overall likelihood of the property damage and associated business interruptions should an incident occur</li>
                    <li>Locating occupied buildings away from hazardous areas, such that the risk to occupants is eliminated or otherwise reduced to ALARP</li>
                    <li>Locating facility offices, workshops, laboratories and other similar buildings not directly linked to facility operation control separately from the control building in a non-hazardous area</li>
                    <li>Locating onsite facilities such that overhead electrical power transmission lines do not cross-over the site (for additional details on clearance from overhead power transmission lines refer to the relevant KOC document</li>
                    <li>Accessibility for maintenance and operations in determining spacing arrangements, as well as locating:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equipment needing frequent overhaul, maintenance or cleaning at unit boundaries</li>
                        <li>Large vessels or equipment close to unit boundaries to allow easy access of cranes etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <br>
