                <h2>Concept Siting Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>During the facility siting for concept selection the end user should consider the following siting considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When selecting the site, an ideal choice would be one with no neighbours to minimize off-site risk potential. The decision should focus on the density of population surrounding the proposed site and existence of any sensitive populations or areas. A site in a remote, unpopulated area is preferable to a site in a highly populated urban area</li>
                    <li>Where the residential housing is located in proximity to a facility, the housing shall be upwind or crosswind of the prevailing wind direction</li>
                    <li>The prevailing wind direction applicable to a particular location shall be determined for each case. Appropriate consideration of the prevailing wind conditions is one of the most critical siting aspects during this stage of the project.</li>
                    <li>In selecting a site, allowance should be made for facility emergencies.</li>
                </ul>

                <i style="color: red;">Further information in relation to these aspects is given in the Guidelines, Section 5.2.</i>
