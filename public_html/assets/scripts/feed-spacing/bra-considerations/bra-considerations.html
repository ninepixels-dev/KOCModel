                <h2>FEED BRA Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>BRA Phase 2 is applied during the FEED Stage (PGS 3.1). </p>
                <p>The objective of BRA Phase 2 is to verify the buildings locations through a more detailed assessment as necessary using the engineering formulas and tool(s) provided in this document and/or other tools as may be listed in the following sections and/or approved by KOC HSE department.</p>
                <p>The evaluation is intended primarily for occupied and functionally significant buildings. Other buildings that do not meet the occupancy or functionality criteria should be reviewed during Phase 2 using the Building Review Checklist given the table below, for identification of any areas of improvement</p>
                <i style="color: red;">Further information in relation to these aspects is given in the Guidelines, Section 11.2.3.</i>
