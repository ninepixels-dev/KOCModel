                <h2>FEED General Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This section relates to the field spacing arrangements during FEED stage of the project (PGS Gate 3.1). The intent here is to allow the end user to arrive at appropriate field spacing arrangements during FEED.</p>
                <p>Before commencing field spacing for all project stages (and in particular PGS 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1), the end user should consider the general Safety Engineering Consideration as given in the Guidelines, Part B.</p>
                <p>Additional references to the pertinent sections in the Guidelines which should be reviewed by the end user for field spacing during FEED (PGS 3.1) are as follows:</p>
