                <h2>FEED Equipment Spacing Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The implications of equipment spacing are similar to the implications in layout and segregation, in that the principal consideration is prevention of escalation of a major accident from one item of equipment to another due to insufficient physical isolation between the items of equipment.</p>
                <p>A detailed set of FEED Spacing Considerations is provided in the Guidelines, Section 8 and is not repeated here.</p>
                <i style="color: red;">Further information in relation to these aspects is given in the Guidelines, Section 8.</i>
