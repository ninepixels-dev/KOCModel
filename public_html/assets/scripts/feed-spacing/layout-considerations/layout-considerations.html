                <h2>FEED Layout & Segregation Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The principal implications associated with the layout and segregation during FEED is the major accident escalation, due to inadequate means of physical isolation between adjacent process units within the same assessed facility, and further escalation due to insufficient measures for control of major accidents, as well as, for emergency response, evacuation and rescue.</p>
                <p>The objectives here are to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minimize risk to personnel working at the facility</li>
                    <li>Minimize escalation from one to adjacent process units</li>
                    <li>Ensure adequate access for firefighting and rescue, and</li>
                    <li>Allow flexibility in combining units of similar hazard potential.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A detailed set of FEED Layout and Segregation Considerations is provided in the Guidelines, Section 7 and is not repeated here.</p>
                <i style="color: red;">Further information in relation to these aspects is given in the Guidelines, Section 7.</i>
