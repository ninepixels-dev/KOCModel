                <h2>FEED Siting Considerations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The main considerations related to the facility siting during FEED are to consider, for each assessed facility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The safety engineering considerations mentioned in Section 2.1</li>
                    <li>Importance of protecting the public from exposure to spills, fires, explosions, heat, smoke, odours, hazardous releases, noise, etc.</li>
                    <li>Including into assessments present and possible future activities adjacent to the facility site, and operations on any rights-of-way for highways, pipelines, etc. that may traverse the property</li>
                    <li>Facility Siting should be designed such that the risk to surrounding areas from major accident events has been minimised as far as reasonably practicable</li>
                    <li>Where the residential housing is in close proximity to the facility, the facility is sited such that the housing is upwind or crosswind from the facility, based on the prevailing wind direction applicable to facilityâ€™s specific location and conditions.</li>
                    <li>The inherently safety design considerations:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing optimum separation distance between the areas containing major hazards and the areas occupied by personnel and public</li>
                        <li>Where separation by distance is not reasonably practicable (e.g. due to space constraints etc.), then the separation shall be provided by use of physical barriers appropriately design to withstand the impacts of major accidents</li>
                        <li>Arranging facilities such that the risk levels are reduced towards the areas occupied by personnel or the surrounding population, i.e. such that the areas of lesser risk are located closer to the areas occupied by personnel or surrounding population.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
