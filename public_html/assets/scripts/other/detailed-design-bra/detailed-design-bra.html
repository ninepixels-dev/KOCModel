                <h2>BRA Phase 3 â€“ Additional Assessment</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This BRA Phase reviews the building risks during the Project Execution (Phase 1): Detailed Engineering & Design (PGS 4.1).</p>
                <p>Phase 3 of BRA may only be required for unusual cases where risk-reduction measures are not clearly appropriate. In this case, a full-blown QRA is performed to evaluate the acceptability of the risks associated with the buildings of concern.</p>
                <p>This phase of BRA reviews the risks associated with the identified hazards. It is anticipated that new projects should rarely require BRA Phase 3 because it is feasible to mitigate the hazards identified in previous BRA Phases by proper attention to building design and location.</p>
                <p>If BRA Phase 3 is required, the KOC Controlling Team must review and approve the scope, methodology, and results of the analysis.</p>
                <p>Details regarding BRA Phase 3 shall be determined on a case-by-case basis after the conclusion of BRA Phase 2.</p>
