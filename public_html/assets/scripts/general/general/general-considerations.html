                <br>
                <p>This Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) FIELD SPACING TOOL is designed to be used in conjunction with the KOC Field Spacing Guidelines.</p>
                <p>The figure below indicates Guidelines application flowchart during the different project stages, as managed through KOC Project Gate System (PGS) process. The PGS is the governing framework used by KOC for selecting, planning and managing capital projects (that meets specific criteria) in a consistent and disciplined manner throughout the Project lifecycle.</p>

                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <p>This FIELD SPACING TOOL is aimed at eliminating or otherwise controlling risk associated with the loss of hydrocarbon containment at, or near the KOC facilities, through robust assessment of field spacing and building risk, at appropriate points of the project and facility lifecycle.
                <p>The objective is to provide the straightforward process for achieving spacing which is safe, as far as reasonably practicable, for the appropriate stages during the KOC project lifecycle process for design of new and modification of existing facilities; and in particular during the following Project Gates:
                <ul>
                    <li>PGS 2.1 Concept Selection</li>
                    <li>PGS 3.1 Project Definition (Phase 1): Front End Engineering Design (FEED), and</li>
                    <li>PGS 4.1 Project Execution (Phase 1): Detailed Engineering and Design.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Further information may be found in the Field Spacing Guidelines Section 3.</p>
                <h3>Scope</h3>
                <p>This application applies to all KOC onshore facilities and relates to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Siting is placement of the facility in relation to other facilities and adjacent public and 3rd party areas</li>
                    <li>Layout and Segregation are related to placement of the process units in relation to other process units within the facility and segregating by layout more hazardous areas from less hazardous areas</li>
                    <li>Spacing is related to placement of the items of equipment within the process units. Spacing refers to the inter-equipment spacing within individual process units, and</li>
                    <li>Building Risk Assessment (BRA) based on the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practices (RP) Nos. 752 and 753.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Deviations</h3>
                <p>The management of deviations shall be according to the KOC Procedure for Control of Deviations from Mandatory KOC Safety Requirements as given in Appendix to Management of Change Procedure.</p>
                <p>Detailed information related to the management of deviations may be found in the Guidelines, Section 1.9.</p>
                <h3>General Considerations</h3>
                <p>Before commencing field spacing for all project stages (and in particular PGS 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1), the end user should consider the general Safety Engineering Consideration as given in the Guidelines, Part B.</p>
                <p>To assist the end user, the references to the pertinent sections in the Guidelines are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hazard management processes and typical hazardous scenarios (Guidelines Section 4.1)</li>
                    <li>Sources of Ignition (Guidelines Section 4.1.4.2)</li>
                    <li>Difference between fires, explosions and toxic releases (Guidelines Section 4.1.4.3-5)</li>
                    <li>Vulnerabilities (Guidelines Section 4.2)</li>
                    <li>Inherently Safer Design principles and how these may be applied during the project (Guidelines Section 4.4)</li>
                    <li>Consideration for Optimal Facility Spacing (Guidelines Section 4.4.4)</li>
                    <li>Consideration for avoiding Domino Effects of Major Accidents Guidelines (Section 4.4.5)</li>
                    <li>Considerations and process for demonstration of reduction of risk to ALARP (Guidelines Section 4.5)</li>
                    <li>General and Specific Control measures available to the design team to control the risk (Guidelines Section 4.6)</li>
                    <li>Control measures for prevention, detection and control, mitigation, response and recovery (Guidelines Section 4.6.1-2)</li>
                    <li>Differences between the specific control measures for fires, explosions, and toxics (Guidelines Section 4.6.4).</li>
                </ol>
